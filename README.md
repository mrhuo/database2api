# database2api
**database2api** means `DataBase to API`, use database, generate open `API`.

**database2api** is a powerful and convenient tool. Its main function is to automatically generate open `API` interfaces based on the existing database, which can significantly save time and energy for developers. It is especially suitable for scenarios where there is an existing database and an `API` interface needs to be provided, or where only the database is built and the `API` interface needs to be implemented quickly.

## RELEASE ‚úàÔ∏è
- 0.0.2 `2024-7-18` First Released Version
- 0.0.3 `2024-7-20` Add `Bearer` Authentication

## I. Function Introduction ‚ö°
**database2api** can intelligently parse the database structure and automatically generate the corresponding `API` interfaces according to the user's requirements and configuration. It enables you to easily achieve the interaction between the database and external applications without the cumbersome manual coding.

In today's software development, the interaction between the database and external applications is a crucial link. However, manually writing `API` interfaces is often a time-consuming and error-prone task, and it requires proficiency in a certain backend programming language, with a relatively high threshold. The development of **database2api** aims to solve this pain point, allowing developers to focus more on the implementation of business logic rather than spending excessive time and effort on interface development.

For example, in a rapidly evolving project, the database structure may change frequently. Using **database2api**, you only need to update the configuration file to quickly regenerate the API interfaces adapted to the new structure, greatly improving the agility of the project.

Whether you are an individual developer or a team, **database2api** will be your powerful assistant to enhance development efficiency and accelerate the project process. 

## II. Technical Principle üíõ
This tool uses [Ktor](https://ktor.io/) as the underlying framework and `JDBC` as the database access layer. It obtains the database structure through `java.sql.DatabaseMetaData`, and then dynamically registers the `API` routes through `Ktor` to realize the generation of `API` interfaces directly from the database. 

## III. Supported Databases
Currently, **database2api** supports the following mainstream databases:
- ‚úÖ Sqlite
- ‚úÖ MySQL
- ‚úÖ Postgresql
- ‚úÖ Microsoft SQL Server
- ‚úÖ MariaDb

## IV. Advantages
1. **Efficient and convenient**: Through a simple configuration file, the required API interfaces can be quickly generated, greatly improving the development efficiency.
2. **Widespread database support**: Covers common database types to meet the needs of different projects.
3. **Easy to maintain**: The generated interface structure is clear, the code is standardized, and it is convenient for subsequent expansion and testing.

After successful startup, the directory structure becomes:

```text
‚îÇ  database2api.jar
‚îî‚îÄ data
     ‚îÇ  setting.ini
     ‚îÇ  tables.json      <-- This is the name of all tables in the database, and it will not be retrieved from the database again on the next startup, and this file will be used directly. If the database has been updated, delete this file.
     ‚îÇ  table_names.json <-- This is the structure of all tables in the database, and it will not be retrieved from the database again on the next startup, and this file will be used directly. If the database has been updated, delete this file.
     ‚îî‚îÄ ext              <-- Directory for placing extended APIs (optional)
     ‚îî‚îÄ web              <-- Directory for static files (optional)
         ‚îî‚îÄ index.html   <-- This is the default homepage of the static webpage.
```

Open the browser and visit [http://127.0.0.1:8080](http://127.0.0.1:8080). If the configuration `API_INDEX_ENABLED=true` is enabled, the interface will be as follows at this time:

> The port setting can be found in the configuration file `API_PORT=8080`<br/>
> If `API_INDEX_ENABLED=false` is set, the `API` documentation interface will not be displayed.

Find a test to get all data at will: `http://127.0.0.1:8080/api/DEVICE/all`

> Here, `DEVICE` is the table name in the database

Test paged data display again: http://127.0.0.1:8080/api/DEVICE/paged

![screenshots/image3.png](screenshots/image3.png)

It can be seen that just by configuring the database link, a complete and usable API interface is automatically generated, which is very convenient.

## VI. Interface Security

Two authorization and authentication methods, Basic and JWT, are now supported, and the configuration is as follows:

```text
# Whether to enable the interface authorization access function
API_AUTH_ENABLED=false
# Interface authorization access, supports: Basic, JWT,
API_AUTH_TYPE=JWT
# List of user names and passwords allowed to access the interface
API_AUTH_USERS=admin:123456,user:1234
```

#### Basic Authorization

- You need to configure `API_AUTH_ENABLED=true` to enable API authorization
- You need to configure `API_AUTH_TYPE=Basic` (note the case)
- You need to configure `API_AUTH_USERS=user:pass,user1:pass1` to set the allowed user password pairs

![Authorization failure](screenshots/auth-basic-failed.png)

> Basic authorization success demo

![Authorization success](screenshots/auth-basic-success.png)

#### JWT Authorization

- You need to configure `API_AUTH_ENABLED=true` to enable API authorization
- You need to configure `API_AUTH_TYPE=JWT` (note the case)
- You need to configure `API_AUTH_USERS=user:pass,user1:pass1` to set the allowed user password pairs

Note that for JWT authorization, a separate user login interface is provided, and the path is `/api/api-user-login`. The `api` prefix in the front is set by the configuration `API_PREFIX`.

## VII. Advanced Content

#### Extended API

Extended API, simply put, is to write a JS file as an API extension interface, perform database access, and complete the function of API requests.

To enable it, set `EXT_API_ENABLED=true` in the configuration file, create an `ext` directory under the `data` directory, and create the file `get_hello.js` with the following content:

> Note: The file name format is {get|post}_{api_name}.js

```js
function main() {
    var name = context.query.name || "no name";
    return "hello " + name;
}
```

Specify the function name `main`. After restarting **database2api**, you can see the console prompt:

```text
2024-07-14 17:26:58.380 [main] INFO  com.mrhuo.plugins.RoutingKt - Database2Api.scriptApiRoute: Successfully created extended API [GET:/api/ext/hello]
```

When accessing this API [http://127.0.0.1:8080/api/ext/hello?name=mrhuo](http://127.0.0.1:8080/api/ext/hello?name=mrhuo), the returned result is as follows:

```json
{
  "code": 0,
  "msg": "OK",
  "data": "hello mrhuo"
}
```

**Note**: Because extended APIs use a scripting engine to interpret and execute script code, the performance is not very good. If not necessary, please do not rely too much on this feature.

Currently, two objects, `db` and `context`, are supported in the extended API.

- The `db` object is mainly used for database queries, providing three methods: `db.query(sql)`, `db.queryOne(sql)`, and `db.exec(sql)`.
- The `context` object is mainly used to obtain the current request parameters, providing five objects: `context.uri`, `context.method`, `context.headers`, `context.query`, and `context.body`.
